    <p class="newsp">Baguio City National High School (BCNHS) principal Brenda Cariño has been awarded as 
        one of the Outstanding Women Leaders (OWLs) of Baguio City during the Kababaihan Festival, Mar. 8 at the PFVR Gymnasium.<br><br>

        With the theme, “We Make Change Work for Women,” the event recognized Cariño’s contributions in the
         field of education as part of the celebration of the National Women’s Month.<br><br>
        
        Not only is she managing the largest secondary school in the city, but she is also the head of the 
        National Association of Public Secondary School Heads (NAPSSHI) Baguio chapter, and the secretary in the regional level.<br><br>
        
        Cariño said that she is responsible in promoting and advocating programs that would empower women 
        for leadership. self-reliance and service to others.<br><br>
        
        “I will be ready to be part of the city’s programs and activities, to coordinate with the city 
        government regarding programs for development, especially for the women’s sector,” she said.<br><br>
        
        Cariño also wants to tell all the other women that they could be empowered and do well in the roles they take in the society.<br><br>
        
        “Let us continue to believe in ourselves that we can be the best person in the respective roles
         that we are called to be — a mother, a sister, a grandmother, and a friend to all; that we should 
         be strong in all the challenges in life and believe that God is our stronghold in all these challenges,” Carino said.<br><br>

    <p class="newsp">A Girl Scout from Baguio City National High School (BCNHS) took over the mayoral seat at 
        City Hall on Oct. 14 for the annual Scouts Official for a Day (SOFAD).<br><br>
        Scout Aevrylle Malihod, a Grade 10 student in the Science Technology and Engineering program, 
        topped the examination of candidates held last Sept. 6 and the one-on-one interview on Sept. 10.<br><br>
        “The exam was quite difficult and I struggled, but I did my very best to pass and secure the
         position,” said Malihod, who also expressed her gratitude to her comrades and Troop Leader Anne Margaret Garcia.<br><br>
        She added that she is looking forward to taking over the position of the mayor since it would 
        give her opportunities to hone her leadership skills.<br><br>
        “I’m really just happy because I will be able to experience how things work in politics,
         it is also good exposure anyway. I want to better my leadership skills and this will be a great 
         step towards it, I will also be able to open my eyes to the real struggles in the world,” Malihod said.<br><br>     
        Having secured a position in City Hall before, Malihod said she already has plans on regulations 
        that she would like to be implemented.<br><br>       
        “I would include strict implementation of proper waste management, incentive for honor students,
         and strict implementation of the anti-distraction law to the things I would like to work on in the future.”<br><br>

    <h3 class="newsh">PNP LAUNCHES INFORMATION DRIVE IN CITY HIGH <br> September 30, 2019 </h3>
    <p class="newsp"> To inform the students on the different ordinances in Baguio City, the Philippine National 
        Police conducted an information drive at Baguio City National High School (BCNHS) from June to September.<br><br>

        Police personnel went from room to room to orient students from grades 7 to 9 about curfews, anti-distracted 
        walking and anti-profanity ordinances, and gang affiliation; whereas Grade 10 students were informed about
         anti-terrorism and illegal drug abuse.<br><br>
        
        According to Police Corporal Greggy William Biado Jr., they are conducting this information drive because 
        of the evident lack of knowledge of the students about the said ordinances.<br><br>
        
        “We did this orientation because we observed that there is insufficient information dissemination through 
        Faceebook and social media,” Biado said.<br><br>
        
        Layagan added that the police were just focusing on the grade 10, but the SADAC asked them to include the
         other grade levels in the orientation.<br><br>
        
        “Their original plan was just to come and lecture to the grade 10 students, but we grabbed the opportunity 
        to coordinate with them such that they will also orient the other grade levels,” Layagan said.<br><br>
        
        Aira Allaga, a grade 9 student, said that the symposium was beneficial to them as students.<br><br>
        
        “The orientation made us aware that there are ordinances such as these in the community and it made us 
        know how to behave while we are here in the city,” she said.<br><br>

           Licensure Examination held on Sept. 10-11.<br><br>

          As a student in the star section and writer for The Pine Tree, Balbin said he was grateful
           to City High for being a part of his formative years in education.<br><br>
          
          “City High is a partner. It was able to let me test a lot of many waters in order for me
           to cipher which water should I swim deeper or which ones should I just dip my toe,”
            said the magna cum laude graduate of Benguet State University.<br><br>
          
          As an achiever, Balbin gave tips on study habits that helped him succeed in his studies.<br><br>
          
          “We all have our own styles of learning and reviewing. So my word is that you review 
          or learn with the way you are comfortable with. But if you don’t know what is comfortable
           for you, my tip is you should know yourself better!”<br><br>

  <h3 class="newsh">CITY HIGH IS BRIGADA ESKWELA HALL OF FAME AWARDEE<br>November 29, 2019 </h3>
    <p class="newsp">For three consecutive years of bagging the Brigada Eskwela Best Implementer award, Baguio City
       National High School (BCNHS) has attained a Hall of Fame status in the Cordillera region.<br><br> 

      Besting five big schools in the region, City High once again topped the Mega school category with Abra High School
       coming in second and Tublay School of Home Industries, third.<br><br> 
      
      Brenda Cariño, the school principal, said that the school owes the recognition to the stakeholders and 
       institutions who participate during the conduct of Brigada Eskwela.<br><br> 
      
      “We have strengthened our partnership with our stakeholders and, of course, we acknowledge the participation of 
      the teachers and students. Every year, they commit themselves by giving donations and assistance,” she said.
      Having achieved a Hall of Fame status, the school will no longer be part of the annual search for Best Brigada Implementer.<br><br> 

      Cariño said, however, that City High still needs to sustain its implementation of Brigada projects, especially since 
      DepEd officials will continue to evaluate and validate the school’s programs.<br><br> 
      
      “We cannot be part of the competition anymore, but maybe there’s a criteria for the Most Sustained School implementer
       of the Brigada Eskwela. Maybe DepEd personnel will come to visit and validate what’s going on with our Brigada program,” she said.<br><br>
